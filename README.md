# Data prediction model

Simple machine-learning-based program for predicting stock prices using LSTM.

This is my first contact with AI-based programming and the code is based on Computer Science's [YouTube video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIUxPv5PJOY&t=263s).


## Installation

Install the required dependecies with:

```bash
  pip install pandas-datareader numpy pandas scikit-learn keras matplotlib yfinance
